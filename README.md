This program reads an Excel sheet used for RunRPG at the NEXRAD ROC.

It must be formatted according to the comments.

A GUI will ask you to select th Excel file, then the program will read the Level III directories, make NCR/NTV/NMD directories, copy the files to the subdirectories, then process the Level III files.
